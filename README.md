# Password-Generator
A password generator that randomly selects a passcode based on selected criteria 

## Description 

 I began this project by deploying the html doc and testing whether the generator was working.

After trying the generator, I decided it would be best to set an array with acceptable password characters.

Line 12 and 13 list the alphabet as well as numbers and special characters.

Last, I needed to set a parameter to detect the desired length of a random password. To do this, I set a variable named "passwordLength". Line 15 through 19 demonstrates how the generator randomly acquires acceptable characters from the array listed above.
